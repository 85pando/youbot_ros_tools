youbot_ros_tools
================

Use the hydro-revel for more stable and tested code.

## Goals

+ use the kinematics and dynamics specs from [youbot-store][1].
+ use the last meshes also
+ fix the "joint issue" (joints are moving too slowly)
+ improve readability by keeping the official parameters in parameter files

## Link

This branch is currently developed in [this repo][2], before merging.
